# ServiceBricks - Microservices Foundation

ServiceBricks is the cornerstone for building a microservices foundation. Visit http://ServiceBricks.com to learn more.

# Quick Notes From Author

* I am working to get everything uploaded, creating examples and documentation. The new website is currently not working yet but the old one is. Check out http://ServiceBrick.com for the time being.
* Start a discussion if you need any help.

## Overview

ServiceBricks provides the core architectural patterns, implementation, standardization and governance for your microservice foundation.
It exposes a storage platform agnostic model and repository-based API that works the same for SQL and NoSQL database engines.

## Artificial Intelligence Integration

We are currently training AI on how to build new ServiceBricks microservices and are getting great results! More updates coming on this soon!
