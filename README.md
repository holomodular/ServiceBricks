# ServiceBricks: The Microservices Foundation

## Overview

[ServiceBricks](https://ServiceBricks.com) is a powerful open-source microservices platform designed to streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of distributed systems with artificial intelligence. 
Leveraging Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and a host of advanced features, ServiceBricks empowers teams to create scalable, customizable services tailored to specific business domains.

## MCP Server
ServiceBricks is available as a hosted MCP server (Model Context Protocol).

**Server ID (Official MCP Registry):** io.github.holomodular/servicebricks  
**Endpoint (Streamable HTTP):** https://servicebricks.com/api/mcp

## Why ServiceBricks?

* **FREE:** MIT-licensed, ServiceBricks offers advanced technology as a secure foundation for anyone to build on.
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Generate production-grade microservices from a single natural-language sentence.
* **Evolution:** Evolve data models and functionality using our online tools.
* **Advanced Architecture:** Built-in patterns, standards, and governance for microservices at scale.
* **REST APIs:** Expose standardized, secure REST APIs to manage your data.
* **Storage Agnostic:** Interchangeably supports relational, document, cloud or embedded database engines
* **Seamless Integration:** Switch storage providers without disrupting services and avoid vendor lock-in.


## Major Features

* **Artificial Intelligence Integration:** Use our tools to leverage large language models to build, query and manipulate your microservice data.
* **Generics:** Extensive use of generics, allowing the compiler to generate most of the required source code.
* **REST API Services:** Templated, repository-based services for quickly exposing standard CRUD+PQV (Patch, Query, Validate) methods or build your own custom methods.
* **[ServiceQuery Integration](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceQuery):** Supports standardized, polyglot, dynamic data querying for all database engines.
* **[Business Rule Engine](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/BusinessRuleEngine.md):** Polymorphic techniques to build reusable business logic.
* **[Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/FlowOfData.md) & [Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/EventDrivenArchitecture.md):** Customize business logic for any supported object and method.
* **[Background Processing](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/BackgroundTasks.md):** Supports asynchronous processes, tasks, and rules.
* **[Relational, Document, Cloud and Embedded Database Support](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/SupportedDatabaseEngines.md):** Works standard with AzureSQL, Azure Storage Accounts, Cosmos DB, InMemory, MongoDB, Postgres, SQLite, SQL Server and more.
* **[Service Bus Engine](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/BroadcastsAndServiceBus.md):** Supports broadcasts of system data with InMemory and Azure Service Bus.
* **[Classic or Modern REST API Design](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/ClassicVsModernRestApi.md):** Choose between Classic or Modern modes, with various response formats.
* **[NuGet Packages](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation/blob/main/V1/NuGet.md):** Quickly build new services and applications.
* **Testing Framework:** Comprehensive Xunit test framework for robust unit and integration testing with thousands of tests available.
* **Open Source:** All referenced assemblies are open source and licensed under MIT or an equivalent license.


## Getting Started with Examples

Explore our [ServiceBricks-Examples](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Examples) repository for practical examples on hosting and deploying your ServiceBricks foundation. From single, monolithic web applications to distributed, multi-deployment, containerized web applications, these examples provide the building blocks to create and scale your own foundations quickly.

## Documentation

Check out our [ServiceBricks-Documentation](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceBricks-Documentation) repository for comprehensive documentation on the platform, including guides on using all components and developing your own microservices.
